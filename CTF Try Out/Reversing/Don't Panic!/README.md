### Description:

You've cut a deal with the Brotherhood; if you can locate and retrieve their stolen weapons cache, they'll provide you with the kerosene needed for your makeshift explosives for the underground tunnel excavation. The team has tracked the unique energy signature of the weapons to a small vault, currently being occupied by a gang of raiders who infiltrated the outpost by impersonating commonwealth traders. Using experimental stealth technology, you've slipped by the guards and arrive at the inner sanctum. Now, you must find a way past the highly sensitive heat-signature detection robot. Can you disable the security robot without setting off the alarm?
